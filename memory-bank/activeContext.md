# Tandem - Active Context

## Current Focus
As of April 22, 2025, we have implemented both the core matching functionality and the messaging system for the Tandem virtual community web application. The POC (Proof of Concept) development is progressing well, with two major components now operational. Our focus is now on the profile system and community discovery features.

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Profile System Enhancement**: Complete the profile components and user experience
2. **Community Discovery**: Build the community activity feed and discovery features
3. **UI Polish**: Refine the visual design and user interactions
4. **Testing**: Ensure all implemented features work seamlessly together

### Currently Working On
- Building the profile page and its components
- Designing the community discovery interface
- Integrating all components into a cohesive user experience

## Recent Decisions

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite (implemented and working well)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.3.5 (stable version after downgrading from v4)
- **State Management**: React hooks for component state (working effectively)
- **Data Storage**: Mock data services with localStorage (providing realistic functionality)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (implemented with nested routes)

### Feature Prioritization
- ✅ Completed core matching system with algorithm based on skills, interests, and proximity
- ✅ Implemented full messaging functionality with conversation list and message threads
- Advancing implementation based on natural user flow: find matches → connect → participate in community

### Design Approach
- Implemented a clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Created responsive layouts that work across device sizes
- Used consistent color schemes and component styling

## Key Insights & Patterns

### Core Product Elements
1. **Local-First Philosophy**: Successfully implemented proximity as a factor in match scoring and display.

2. **Complementary Skills Matching**: Implemented the algorithm that prioritizes skill/need complementarity.

3. **Interest-Based Discovery**: Integrated shared interests into the matching algorithm and display.

4. **Community-Oriented**: Created the foundation for community features (to be enhanced).

5. **Non-Transactional Exchange**: Emphasized learning and sharing in both matching and messaging interfaces.

### Implementation Patterns
1. **Progressive Profile Building**: Structure created, UI implementation in progress.

2. **Quality-Based Match Scoring**: Successfully implemented with visual percentage indicators.

3. **Activity-Centered Community**: Data model created, UI implementation in progress.

4. **Serendipitous Discovery**: Matching algorithm promotes unexpected connections based on complementary factors.

5. **Direct Communication**: Messaging system enables immediate connection after matching.

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete the Profile page implementation
2. Build the Community discovery features
3. Enhance UI with animations and transitions
4. Test the integrated user flow from matching to messaging
5. Add responsive design improvements for mobile

### Post-POC Refinements
1. Gather feedback on the implemented features
2. Refine the matching algorithm based on observations
3. Enhance the mobile experience
4. Add more interactive elements

### Future Development (Beyond POC)
1. Develop backend API and database
2. Implement real authentication
3. Add geolocation services
4. Develop real-time messaging
5. Implement community moderation tools
6. Add image upload and management
7. Deploy to production

## Active Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Successfully implemented both matching and messaging systems with mock data
- Resolved Tailwind CSS configuration issues by using a stable version
- Implemented real-time UI updates for message sending without complex state management
- Maintained consistent styling across all components

### Product Challenges
- Successfully demonstrated key value propositions through matching and messaging
- Created realistic conversations and messaging flow in the mock data
- Working on conveying the community-building aspects in the next phase
- Ensuring intuitive connection between matches and messaging

### Implementation Insights
- Service layer pattern works well for both matching and messaging features
- Component architecture facilitates reuse across different parts of the application
- Two-panel layout for messaging provides intuitive interface on both mobile and desktop
- Navigation between features is smooth and intuitive

## Development Environment

### Local Setup
Successfully implemented and tested development environment with:
- React + Vite (working efficiently)
- Tailwind CSS v3.3.5 (stable and reliable)
- React Router v6 (with nested routes working properly)
- Local storage persistence (handling mock data successfully)
- Git version control with GitHub repository

### Version Control
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/mikemates/tandem.git
- Initial codebase committed and pushed
- README.md created with comprehensive project documentation
- Commit history tracking major implementation milestones

### Project Structure
Successfully implemented and expanded the planned structure:

## Recent Learnings

With both matching and messaging systems implemented, we've learned:

1. **Component Reuse Saves Time**: Creating reusable components like message bubbles and cards accelerates development.

2. **Service Layer Pattern Works Well**: Separating service logic from UI components keeps code clean and maintainable.

3. **Progressive Enhancement Is Key**: Building core features first, then enhancing with polish yields better results.

4. **User Flow Matters**: Implementing features following the natural user journey improves the overall experience.

5. **Responsive Design Takes Planning**: Mobile-first approach with adaptable layouts works well for this application.

## Next Implementation Focus

1. Complete the profile page implementation with skill and interest management
2. Build the community discovery interface with activity cards
3. Implement navigation between all major features
4. Add animations and transitions for a more polished feel
5. Test the complete user journey across different scenarios
6. Make regular commits to GitHub as features are implemented
