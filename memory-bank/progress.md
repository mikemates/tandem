## What's In Progress

### Implementation
- âœ… Profile page implementation 
- âœ… Messaging functionality
- âœ… Community discovery features

## What's Next

### Short-Term (Next Phase)
1. Add additional UI polish
2. Address any bugs or issues
3. Enhance form validation and error handling
4. Add animations for smoother transitions

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Placeholder content for Profile and Community pages
- No server-side implementation (using mock data)
- No real authentication (simulated login state)
- No real-time functionality for messaging

## Implementation Progress

### Data Models
- âœ… User Profile model

- âœ… Interests model
- âœ… Matching model
- âœ… Messaging model (basic)
- âœ… Community Activity model

### Core Features
- âœ… Profile Creation & Display
- âœ… Matching Algorithm
- âœ… Match Display
- âœ… Messaging Interface
- âœ… Community Discovery
- âœ… Activity Participation

### UI Components
- âœ… Basic Layout and Navigation
- âœ… Match Card
- âœ… Match List with filters
- âœ… Match Details
- âœ… Conversation List
- âœ… Message Thread
- âœ… Activity Card
- âœ… Activity List with filters
- âœ… Activity Detail
- ðŸ”² Map View

## Technical Debt

### Items to Address Post-POC
- Backend API for data persistence

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2025-04-22 | Use React + Vite | Rapid development with HMR | Next.js, Create React App |
| 2025-04-22 | Use Tailwind CSS | Quick styling with utility classes | Styled Components, CSS Modules |
| 2025-04-22 | Use localStorage | Avoid backend dependency for POC | Mock API, JSON Server |
| 2025-04-22 | Focus on profile, matching, and community discovery | Client priority areas | Full authentication flow, admin features |
| 2025-04-22 | Simple match scoring algorithm | Demonstrate concept without complexity | ML-based matching, more complex algorithm |
| 2025-04-22 | Use Tailwind CSS v3.3.5 | Stability issues with v4 | Use newer version with workarounds |
| 2025-04-22 | Set up GitHub repository | Version control and collaboration | Other Git hosting services |

## Learning & Insights

### What's Working Well
- Component-based architecture allows for quick implementation and iteration
- Mock data services provide realistic functionality without backend
- React Router gives clear navigation structure
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid styling with consistent design
- Reusable service layer pattern for both matching and messaging

### Challenges Encountered
- Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues, had to downgrade to v3.3.5
- Proper structuring of the match components for reusability
- Balancing feature completeness with timeline constraints
- Managing real-time UI updates in React components

### Adjustments Made
- Simplified some UI elements to focus on core functionality
- Used stable versions of dependencies over cutting-edge ones
- Focused on completing key user flows (match finding â†’ messaging) before adding more features
- Implemented a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop

## Next Steps for Memory Bank
- Continue updating progress.md as implementation proceeds
- Document messaging and community discovery implementations as they are completed
- Record any additional challenges and solutions
- Update activeContext.md to reflect shifting priorities
- Maintain documentation of git workflow and versioning
