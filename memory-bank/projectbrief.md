# Tandem - Project Brief

## Project Vision
Tandem is a local-first platform focused on authentic community building through skills exchange and interest matching. The platform enables users to connect based on complementary needs, abilities, and passions within a local community context.

### Brand Promise
"Find your people. Build your place."

### Core Differentiators
- **Local-first vs. global-first approach**: Prioritizing proximity for real-world connections
- **Community-building vs. transactional exchanges**: Value exchange over monetary transactions
- **Authentic connections vs. algorithmic feeds**: Meaningful matches over endless scrolling
- **Skill and interest matching vs. service marketplace**: Learning and sharing rather than buying and selling
- **Serendipitous discovery vs. utilitarian search**: Encouraging unexpected connections
