## Technical Constraints

### POC Limitations
- **No Backend**: The POC will use client-side storage only, limiting persistence and multi-user functionality
- **Simulated Authentication**: Authentication will be simulated with localStorage
- **Static Location Data**: Geographic features will use fixed coordinates rather than real geolocation
- **Limited Scale**: The system is not designed to handle large data volumes
- **Mock Images**: Using placeholder images for profiles and activities
- **No Real-time Updates**: Messages and activities won't update in real-time
- **Browser Compatibility**: Targeting modern browsers only for the POC

### Technical Debt Considerations
- **Data Persistence**: Will need proper backend implementation
- **Authentication**: Will need secure authentication system
- **Geolocation**: Will need proper geolocation services
- **Real-time Features**: Will need WebSockets or similar
- **Image Handling**: Will need image upload, storage, and CDN
- **Performance Optimization**: Will need optimization for scale
- **Accessibility**: Will need full accessibility audit and implementation

## Development Standards

### Code Style
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Clean, well-documented code with comments where necessary
- Component-based architecture with separation of concerns
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Component Guidelines
- Small, focused components with single responsibilities
- Clear prop interfaces
- Consistent patterns for handling loading, errors, and empty states
- Responsive design considerations throughout

### State Management
- Context providers for global state
- Component-level state for UI-specific concerns
- Careful prop drilling avoidance
- Performance considerations for re-renders

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind utility classes for rapid development
- Consistent color scheme and spacing
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible UI components with appropriate contrast ratios

## Performance Considerations

### Initial Load Performance
- Code splitting for route-based chunking
- Lazy loading of components not needed on initial render
- Image optimization for faster page loads
- Minimal dependencies to reduce bundle size

### Runtime Performance
- Virtual list rendering for long lists
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- useCallback for stable function references
- useMemo for derived data

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly UI with appropriate tap targets
- Reduced data usage where possible
- Responsive layout adaptations for small screens
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security (POC)
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Data sanitization before display
- Content security policy considerations
- Safe localStorage usage for temporary data

### Future Security Implementation
- Proper authentication and authorization system
- HTTPS enforcement
- API rate limiting
- Data encryption
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention

## Integration Points (Future)

### Geolocation Services
- Integration with mapping APIs for proximity calculations
- Reverse geocoding for location display
- Privacy controls for location data

### Authentication Services
- OAuth providers for social login
- Email verification services
- Two-factor authentication

### Storage and Media
